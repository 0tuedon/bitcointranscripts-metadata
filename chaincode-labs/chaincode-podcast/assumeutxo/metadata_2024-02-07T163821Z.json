We talked to James about his experience at the Chaincode residency (https://residency.chaincode.com), his most recent project Assume UTXO (https://github.com/jamesob/assumeutxo-docs/tree/2019-04-proposal/proposal) and how he champions and effects change in Bitcoin Core.\n\nDiscussed in this episode:\n- 2018 residency (https://medium.com/@ChaincodeLabs/chaincode-residency-2018-26cd8a65d5f7) (2:42) \n- Choosing what to work on (5:40)\n- Fork detection framework (6:55)\n- Initial block download (IBD) (https://btcinformation.org/en/glossary/initial-block-download) (8:10) \n- What a node does during IBD 1110\n- DNS seeds (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41673073/how-does-the-bitcoin-client-determine-the-first-ip-address-to-connect) (11:30)\n- UTXO set (https://btcinformation.org/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output) (12:30) \n- Parallelized signature validation (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2060) (14:20) \n- Assume valid (https://bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/08/release-0.14.0/#assumed-valid-blocks) (14:40) \n- Different than checkpoints (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_Core_0.11_(ch_5):_Initial_Block_Download#Checkpoints) (17:30) \n- Updating assume valid value in the code (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9484) (19:00)\n- Assume UTXO () (21:20) \n- Platform and memory considerations (27:15)\n- Criticisms (27:55)\n- Championing a big change in Bitcoin Core (32:20)\n\nIf you like this, find more shows at https://podcast.chaincode.com.
